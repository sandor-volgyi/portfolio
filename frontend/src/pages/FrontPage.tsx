Summary:
In the last 6 years I worked for multinational companies on data oriented tasks. As i was playing around with php, sql, html, css, jquery and web scraping since high school I soon started to automate things. First I learnt some excel VBA. Automatedsome reporting with SQL and excel pivot tables, then started using some dynamic reporting and automating tools - Alteryx, Report monitor, WeBi, basic Tableau and Qlikview. I acquired good problem solving skills.

Motivation:
I was alway more interested in the technical challenges in my job. Automating processes and building useful tools is something that makes sense to me. While i can commit myself to repetitive tasks, I prefer automating them if possible. What I love in programming is that it is easier to see the results of my job and can provide challenges that i enjoy taking on.
